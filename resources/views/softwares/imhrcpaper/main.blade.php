            <p>
                IMHRC (Inter-Module Hub Removal Clustering) is a graph clustering algorithm that is developed based on inter-module hub removal in the weighted graphs which can detect overlapped clusters. Due to these properties, it is especially useful for detecting protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with associated confidence values. IMHRC by removing some of the inter-module hubs and module hubs, eliminates a meaningful percentage of noise in the dataset and indirectly consider difference occurrence time of the PPI in the network.  After removing hubs, some proteins are considered as seeds. Each seed creates a primary cluster. Then removed module hubs are added to the resulting clusters based on the amount of their interactions with other proteins in the clusters. Clusters are then merged based on their overlaps.

                IMHRC is available as a standalone command-line application.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Our algorithm provides an accurate and scalable method to detect and
                predict protein complexes from PPI networks. In our assessment four
                experimental yeast PPI datasets have been used which include Gavin (Gavin,
                et al., 2006), Collins (Collins, et al., 2007), Krogan Core and Krogan
                Extended (Krogan, et al., 2006). All these dataset were weighted. For
                evaluating the <span style="mso-no-proof:yes">result</span> of the
                methods, two gold standards were used as benchmarks,</span>

	  protein complex annotations from SGD. </span>To assess the robustness of
                IMHRC against other complex detection algorithms, we selected seven of the
                best algorithms in this topic. These algorithms include:
